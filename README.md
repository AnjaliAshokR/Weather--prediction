# Weather--prediction
## introduction
This repository contains a big data machine learning project which will predict the weather class to which the input image belongs to. It is implemented using tensorflow and keras, the programming language is python
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Keras

### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AnjaliAshokR/Weather--prediction.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells. You can also open the .py file and run the script in your local environment.

## Data
The data used in this project is a image dataset.

## Model
The model used in this project are neural networks. There are two models built based on VGG-16 architecture. One is transfer learning model. Data augmentation is used for increasing the data volume and for avoiding the imbalance in data

## Results
Transfer learning model have a higher accuracy for both training and testing.
